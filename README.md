# Makefile-collection
Personal collection of Makefiles to use as templates for future projects.
## Simple
This makefile can be used for small-medium projects where everything can be structured under `src` and `include` folders.
## Multiple binaries
I created this makefile because I needed to generate multiple binaries at once. Note: works only with single source files.
